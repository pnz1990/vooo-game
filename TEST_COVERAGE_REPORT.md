- âœ… Double jump can only be used once per air time
- âœ… Triple jump is prevented
- âœ… Double jump resets when player lands

### 3. Enemy Scaling by Level (8 tests)
Tests the difficulty scaling system:
- âœ… Level 1: 15 enemies (easier difficulty)
- âœ… Level 1: 20% platform enemy chance
- âœ… Level 2+: 30 enemies (increased difficulty)
- âœ… Level 2+: 40% platform enemy chance
- âœ… Consistent scaling across all levels

### 4. Mixed Enemy Types in Level 4 (10 tests)
Tests the dual enemy type system in Level 4:
- âœ… Both strawberry and cherry enemy types supported
- âœ… Correct enemy properties and dimensions
- âœ… Different movement patterns
- âœ… Random enemy type selection (50/50 distribution)
- âœ… Proper sprite handling for each type

### 5. Dual Boss System in Level 4 (11 tests)
Tests the advanced dual boss mechanic:
- âœ… Two bosses active simultaneously in Level 4
- âœ… Different boss types (cherry and strawberry)
- âœ… Opposite movement directions
- âœ… Correct positioning (first boss right of second)
- âœ… Level completion requires defeating both bosses
- âœ… Single boss system works in other levels

### 6. Game Initialization (12 tests)
Tests core game state and configuration:
- âœ… All game variables properly initialized
- âœ… Level bounds and max level (4) validation
- âœ… Speed multiplier within reasonable bounds
- âœ… Double jump feature enabled by default
- âœ… Proper data types for all variables

### 7. Player Mechanics (15 tests)
Tests player object and movement system:
- âœ… All required player properties present
- âœ… Correct player dimensions (50x70)
- âœ… Jump power calculations with speed multiplier
- âœ… Double jump stronger than regular jump
- âœ… Movement speed affected by level multiplier

### 8. Boss Mechanics (17 tests)
Tests both single and dual boss systems:
- âœ… Boss object structure and properties
- âœ… Correct boss dimensions (100x120)
- âœ… Valid boss types (cherry/strawberry)
- âœ… Second boss object for Level 4
- âœ… Boss movement and collision systems

### 9. Collision Detection (3 tests)
Tests the collision detection algorithms:
- âœ… Overlapping object collision detection
- âœ… Non-overlapping object separation
- âœ… Jumping on enemy detection (from above)

### 10. Asset Loading (13 tests)
Tests game asset management:
- âœ… All asset categories present (vooo, enemies, boss, explosion)
- âœ… Correct asset dimensions
- âœ… Enemy size handling (40x40 initial, 60x60 after loading)
- âœ… Boss hit requirements (5 hits)
- âœ… Explosion system parameters

## Automated Testing Pipeline

### Pre-Push Git Hook
- âœ… Automatically runs all 120 tests before any git push
- âœ… Prevents pushing code that breaks existing functionality
- âœ… Ensures 100% pass rate before code reaches repository
- âœ… Provides detailed test results and failure information

### Test Execution
- **Manual**: `./run-tests.sh` or `npm test`
- **Automatic**: Triggered by git pre-push hook
- **Environment**: Headless Node.js with mocked browser APIs
- **Speed**: Fast execution (~2-3 seconds for all 120 tests)

## Test Quality Metrics

### Coverage Completeness
- **New Features**: 100% coverage of all new game features
- **Existing Features**: Comprehensive coverage of core mechanics
- **Business Logic**: All game rules and mechanics tested
- **Edge Cases**: Boundary conditions and error states covered

## Recommendations for Future Development

### Adding New Features
1. Write tests first (TDD approach)
2. Ensure new tests integrate with existing suite
3. Maintain 100% pass rate requirement
4. Update this coverage report

### Maintaining Test Quality
1. Review and update tests when game logic changes
2. Add tests for any bug fixes
3. Keep test execution time under 5 seconds
4. Maintain clear test descriptions and error messages
