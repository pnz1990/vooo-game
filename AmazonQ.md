# Game Speed Modifications

## Changes Made

1. **Added Level System**:
   - Added `currentLevel` variable to track game progression
   - Level 1 starts at 15% slower speed (speedMultiplier = 0.85)
   - Each subsequent level increases speed by 10% of the base speed

2. **Speed-Dependent Variables**:
   - Modified all speed-related variables to use the `speedMultiplier`:
     - Player movement speed
     - Player jump power
     - Gravity
     - Enemy movement speed
     - Boss movement and jump power

3. **Level Progression**:
   - Level counter increments when player completes a level
   - Speed increases with each level
   - UI shows current level and indicates speed increase for next level

## How It Works

The game now uses a `speedMultiplier` variable that affects all movement in the game:

```javascript
// For Level 1 (15% slower)
speedMultiplier = 0.85;

// For subsequent levels
speedMultiplier = 1 + ((currentLevel - 2) * 0.1);
```

When a player completes a level, the `currentLevel` variable increments, which will increase the `speedMultiplier` for the next game.

## Future Enhancements

To add more levels with different layouts, you could:

1. Create an array of level configurations
2. Add different enemy types and obstacles for each level
3. Implement different boss behaviors for higher levels
4. Add power-ups that temporarily affect the speed multiplier
